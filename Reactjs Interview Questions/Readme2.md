### 1. React Hooks

- **useState**: Initializes and manages local state in functional components. Provides a state variable and a function to update it.
- **useEffect**: Executes side effects like fetching data or modifying the DOM. Runs after every render or only when specific dependencies change.
- **useContext**: Shares global data (like user info or theme) across components without prop drilling.
- **useReducer**: Manages complex state logic by taking a reducer function and initial state, providing state and dispatch functions.
- **useMemo**: Memoizes a computed value to avoid recalculating it on every render, optimizing performance.
- **useCallback**: Memoizes a function to prevent re-creation on each render, ideal for callbacks in child components.
- **useRef**: Holds a mutable object that persists across renders, commonly used to access DOM elements directly.

---

### 2. Higher Order Components (HOC)

- **What?** Functions that wrap a component to add behavior or modify its props, enhancing its functionality.
- **When?** Use HOCs for sharing logic across multiple components without duplicating code (e.g., logging or conditional rendering).
- **Why?** Encourages modular, reusable, and decoupled code.
- **How?** Create a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added behavior or props.

---

### 3. Lifecycle Methods of Components

- **Mounting**: When the component is created and added to the DOM (`constructor`, `componentDidMount` in class components).
- **Updating**: When state or props change, causing a re-render (`componentDidUpdate`).
- **Unmounting**: When the component is removed from the DOM, use `componentWillUnmount` for cleanup tasks like clearing timers.

---

### 4. State Management

- **State vs Props**: State is internal to a component, while props are external data passed from parent to child components.
- **Props Drilling**: Passing props through multiple nested components, which can lead to clutter. Often solved using Context or state libraries.
- **Context**: Shares global state across component trees without explicit prop-passing, useful for managing themes, user data, etc.

---

### 5. Redux or Zustand

- **How Redux Works**: Stores application state centrally. Actions dispatch state changes through reducers.
- **Why?** Redux is ideal for applications needing a single source of truth and state that affects multiple components.
- **When?** Useful in large applications with shared state across many components.
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**: Simplifies Redux setup by reducing boilerplate and managing complex state and async operations more easily.

---

### 6. Custom Hooks

- **When to Use**: For encapsulating reusable logic across components (e.g., data fetching or form handling).
- **Code**: Custom hooks are functions prefixed with “use” that return state or computed values.
- **Why?** They help modularize, reuse, and simplify component logic.

---

### 7. Lazy Loading

- **Code Splitting**: Breaks down the app into smaller bundles to load only the necessary parts, enhancing performance.
- **Chunking**: Uses `React.lazy()` to dynamically load components, reducing initial load time.
- **Suspense**: Works with `React.lazy()` to delay rendering until components are ready, displaying a fallback UI meanwhile.

---

### 8. Virtual DOM

- **Reconciliation Algorithm**: Determines minimal changes needed to update the real DOM, optimizing re-rendering.
- **React Fiber**: Enhances React’s reconciliation algorithm, handling updates more efficiently through asynchronous rendering.
- **Diff Algorithm**: Compares previous and current virtual DOM states to update the real DOM with minimal operations.

---

### 9. SSR vs CSR

- **What?** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) renders on the server, while Client-Side Rendering (CSR) renders on the client after initial load.
- **Difference**: SSR improves initial load speed and SEO, while CSR enables rich interactivity by rendering components on the client.
- **SEO and Performance (SSR)**: SSR allows crawlers to access pre-rendered content, boosting SEO and loading speed for users.

---

### 10. Routing (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)

- **react-router**: A library for defining and handling routes within React, supporting nested and dynamic routes.
- **Protected Routes**: Access-restricted routes, generally gated by authentication checks.
- **Query Params**: URL-based parameters used to pass additional data for dynamic routing.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Allows routes to be generated based on data, providing flexibility in page creation.

---

### 11. Testing

- **React Testing Library**: Facilitates testing by simulating user interactions, focusing on component behavior over implementation.
- **Unit Testing**: Tests isolated code units, such as individual functions or components.
- **Interview Tip**: Emphasize modular, testable code and provide examples of test cases for component interaction.

---

### 12. Async Tasks

- **API Calls**: Retrieves data from external services using libraries like `fetch` or Axios.
- **useEffect (Async)**: Manages async tasks like data fetching, typically with `async` functions.
- **Promises**: JavaScript objects representing asynchronous operations, with `then`, `catch`, and `finally` for handling results.
- **setTimeout**: Delays code execution, useful for debouncing events or throttling user inputs.

---

### 13. Coding Practices

- **Reusability**: Write modular code reusable across multiple components, minimizing duplication.
- **Readability**: Ensure code clarity by following consistent naming conventions, formatting, and including comments.
- **Modularity**: Split code into small, focused modules, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Testability**: Ensure code can be easily tested, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle for smaller, more testable units.

---

### 14. Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads resources when needed, reducing the initial load time and improving speed.
- **Asset Optimization**: Minifies and compresses assets to improve page load times.
- **Bundlers**: Tools like Webpack package code and assets, reducing file sizes and optimizing load times.
- **CDN / Server Level**: Distributes static assets via content delivery networks for faster access.
- **Optimized Rendering**: Uses memoization and efficient data handling to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

---

### 15. Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with predefined classes for quick styling.
- **StyleX**: CSS-in-JS approach that allows flexible inline styling for components.
- **Bootstrap**: Predefined, mobile-first components for rapid UI development.
- **Material UI**: Google’s Material Design components for a sleek and consistent interface.
- **Ant UI**: Comprehensive component library with customizable themes and layouts.
- **CSS / SCSS**: Traditional styling with enhanced SCSS features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
